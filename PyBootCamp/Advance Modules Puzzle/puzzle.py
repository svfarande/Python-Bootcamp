Good work on unzipping the file!
You should now see 5 folders, each with a lot of random .txt files.
Within one of these text files is a telephone number formated ###-###-#### 
Use the Python os module and regular expressions to iterate through each file, open it, and search 
for a telephone number. Good luck!

Telephone number - 719-266-2837 found in 'EMTGPSXQEJX.txt' file which is in 
'C:\\Users\\svfarande\\onedrive\\Documents\\Study MAterial\\Python\\PyCharm Projects
\\PyBootCamp\\Advance Modules Puzzle\\puzzle unzipped\\extracted_content\\Four' directory
At index starting from 1062 to 1074
